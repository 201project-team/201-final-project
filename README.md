TODO 
=======
1.)	Have a timer somewhere on the page

2.)	Create a button starts a timer (this time generates the time)

3.)	games needs to be stopped (by timer)

4.)	tell user the score (and keep track)

5.)	store the score

6.)	We need to program about 500 words

7.)	It would have to do something in the dom that each indvidual letter would have it's own reference in the DOM

8.)	Not case unsensitive (need .toUppercase so that the values get shifted back to lowercase)

9.)	Display timer / Print on page

10.)	Log-In of Sorts (maybe create users/ user profiles)



*Strectch Goal: 

1.)	At the end of the game if the user has improved the score then we should log and promt user about improvement

Questions to ask ourselves:

1.) How are we dividing work?

2.) what is the code we need to create a user profile, how do we store information that user inputs to profile.

3.) What theme would we style the CSS?

4.) research if stringify can be utilized in this project
